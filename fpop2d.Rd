\title{Functional cost 2d display at level beta}
\usage{
fpop2d(data2, beta, nb = 300, circle = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data2}{matrix of data of dimension 2 x n}

\item{beta}{penalty coefficent, positive number}

\item{nb}{An integer : the number of rows in the matrix used for the plots}

\item{circle}{A boolean to decide to draw the circles of intersection (green if the region stays, red otherwise)}
}
\value{
Plots of the functional cost (in the plot window) and the present labels (in the console) at consecutive times
}
\description{
Displaying the functional cost at consecutive times
}
\examples{
data <- dataG2(mean1 = 0, mean2 = 0, tau = 1, sigma = 0.5, n=10)
fpop2d(data, n = 300, 1, circle = TRUE)
